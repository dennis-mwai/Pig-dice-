# Pig-dice

Pig dice is a game which in its basic form is played by a single 6-sided die. The first player to score more than 100 points is considered the winner. To play the game, more than 2 players are needed, and in most cases, less than 10 players are considered.  

## Project Description

This project details a gaming website where 2 players play with a single die. The players are promted to input their names before they proceed to the actual page where they take turns to roll the die. Each time a player rolls, the die can hit any number from 1-6. When a player hits a score of 1, the page displays the hit and asks the player to pass the die. The first player to score 100 points or more wins.
